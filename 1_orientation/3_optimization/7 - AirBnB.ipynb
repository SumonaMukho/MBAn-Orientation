Remember that collecting data is difficult and time-consuming, so you can't just assume that everyone will answer a 10-page questionnaire with detailed questions about their preferences.

If you decide to do this, add the corresponding columns in the preferences.csv file and type in some made-up data so that you can run your model (unfortunately we don't have time for everyone to fill out more surveys).\n",
